How to use:

Buyer-end:
1. Open the word document called Item labels. Each label represents a donated item.
2. Scan the QR code with your phone. 
3. Read and understand the purpose of the application.
4. Enter the Gift Aid number from the word document ("Item Labels") into the Gift Aid field.
5. Press on the show button and scan the barcode from the word document. In case it doesn't work, the code can be typed manually. Phones with three or more cameras tend to use the wide camera as the primary one. The wide camera makes scanning barcodes be a painful task, therefore I'd advice you to enter the code manually if scanning doesn't work from the second try.
6. Write a message and press submit.
7. Press the confirm button when the popup appears.
